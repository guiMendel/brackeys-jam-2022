    out.

    First things first, you''ll notice you don''t look quite the same as
    before. Another merry consequence of your identity crisis.

    So, there''s
    these aliens. We don''t know why, but they really #0.5 <u>really</u> want to
    kill us.

    They are <u>infiltrated</u> among us regular humans, and reveal
    themselves when they recognize us.

    When they spot someone <u>acting out
    of the ordinary</u>, they assume that''s us. So <u>try to blend in</u>.

    They''ll
    usually start suspecting you once you move away from a group of people, or if
    you <u>stand still</u> for too long.

    Ah yes, here, remember we have this
    device that shows us <u>how much they suspect of us</u>.'
