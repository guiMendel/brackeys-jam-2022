    So,
    there''s these aliens. We don''t know why, but they really #0.5 <u>really</u>
    want to kill us.

    They are <u>infiltrated</u> among us regular humans, and
    reveal themselves when they recognize us. So <u>try not to get spotted</u>.

    In
    this simulation, they''ll start suspecting you once you cross the red lines.

    Here,
    remember we have this device that shows us <u>how close they are to spotting
    us</u>.'
