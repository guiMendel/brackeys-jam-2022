  text: 'Long story short, that means you can <u>record your moves</u>, and they
    will get replayed everytime you die.

    Sometimes the aliens may even be able
    to <u>take them out before they did last time</u>, though, so stay on your toes
    always.

    Oh, and if your past clones start wreaking too much havoc around
    you, you can always reset them with the <u>esc</u> key. Keep that in mind!'
