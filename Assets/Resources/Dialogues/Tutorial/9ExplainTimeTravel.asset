  text: "You'll notice this time around we have an extra friend in the safe zone.\r\nThat's
    our <u>past self</u>. So don't become alarmed when the aliens attack him. Bear
    with me.\r\nWe have a gadget that allows us to <u>go back in time</u> at the
    moment we die. #0.3 Sortof.\r\nYou see, our body can't travel in time. But our
    <u>mind</u> can. So what we atually do #0.4 is go back and <u>swap it with someone
    else's mind</u> in the past! #0.2 Hence the identity crisis. #0.5 \r\nBut since
    our old body was also in that same past... You'll notice it's still there, doing
    <u>exactly the same thing</u>, until it eventually dies too."
